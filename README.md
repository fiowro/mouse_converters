# mouse_converters

This repo keeps sources (Arduino sketches, STL files for 3D printed parts, pinouts, etc.) for USB mouse converters we created to try out various mice and trackballs while studying the history of cursor control devices. 
Results of the research have their own repo, [github.com/fiowro/mouses](https://github.com/fiowro/mouses) and a dedicated website, [mouses.info](https://mouses.info).
